# Machine Learning Models Portfolio  

📌 **Description**:  
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning models using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and more. Each model is in its own folder, containing Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts with explanations, visualizations, and practical examples.

## 📝 Credits  
This repository is inspired by the **Udemy course**: *"Learn how to use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, Machine Learning, TensorFlow, and more!"* by **Jose Portilla**. However, the code implementations and explanations are my own.
